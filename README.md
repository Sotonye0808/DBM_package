Project built with a Python CGI script, which renders some functionality null unless properly configured.
Anyone keen on using this project will need to pull it, get the Apache server (other similar services like Azure may suffice) up and running, store it there and perform the necessary configurations to handle the CGI script.
Perhaps modifications will be made to enable it work without any of that.
